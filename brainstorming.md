# Brainstorming

Unfortunately, I don't think I will have time to attempt the extension (CI/CD)
pipeline due to work / uni commitments. Had a quick attempt to set up a linter,
but seem to be running into issues due to the project consisting of multiple 
react projects / microservices.  Attempted npm init and added linting packages
to json with no luck

I know that for the elements of the pipeline we want, we just find them on 
the github actions marketplace and configure our pipeline yml to run them, 
and we can also set it up to run any test files we generate.

I dont have much experience setting up pipelines but i do know the basics of
docker and how to create an image for a python service at least.

Thanks for looking through my attempt and wish the team the best of luck in 
the recruitment process

- thanks
Luis
